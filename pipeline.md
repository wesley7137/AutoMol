    Docking study: If you want to dock this protein with a mitochondrial target, you'd need to use docking software like AutoDock Vina or HADDOCK.
    Mitochondrial environment: For a more accurate simulation, you might want to embed the protein in a mitochondrial membrane model.
    Longer simulations: Depending on your computational resources, you might want to run longer simulations (10-100 ns or more) for better sampling.
    Advanced analysis: Consider analyzing other properties like secondary structure changes, contact maps, or specific interactions relevant to mitochondrial function and mitophagy.
